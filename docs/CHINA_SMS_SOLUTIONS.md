# 🇨🇳 China SMS Solutions

## Current Issue
AWS SNS cannot reliably send SMS to +86 (China) numbers due to regulatory restrictions.

## Solutions for China Market

### Option 1: Chinese SMS Providers

- ✅ Better delivery rates
- ❌ Requires Chinese business registration

### Option 2: Dual SMS Strategy
```
International Users: AWS SNS
China Users (+86): Chinese SMS provider
```
